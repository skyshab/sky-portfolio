The Lake Lucerne Resort is a collection of cottages situated on a small lake in historic Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Their website served as a portal to potential customers, but also provided information for current and upcoming guests.

### Project Highlights

The client was a big fan of skeuomorphic design, and wanted the site to be whimsical, yet sophisticated and retro. We created custom graphics to match the overall theme, and used newly adopted CSS image properties to create dynamic old-postcard-like callout boxes for each cottage.
