### Project Highlights

This project was completed when rounded corners were in demand, yet the majority of browsers in use at the time didnâ€™t support the CSS radius rule. Corner images were generated for all the boxes on the site. At one point, we changed the color scheme for the site, and had to re-generate all of the images. When I look back on that, I am very thankful for all the amazing stuff we can do with pure CSS now.
