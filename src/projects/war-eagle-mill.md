War Eagle Mill is a working historic grain mill complete with a waterwheel-powered millstone. They sell a variety of flours, grains, and mixes through their online store. The mill is also a popular tourist destination with a restaurant and gift shop. They needed their website to reach both of these audiences, and integrate with their e-commerce solution.

### Project Highlights

In order to increase engagement on the site with customers, we created a searchable database of over 100 recipes that use the store’s products. We also developed a character named “Millie” who would pop up in the header and say witty things.
