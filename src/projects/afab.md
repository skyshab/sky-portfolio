A group of research scientists at the University of Arkansas wanted to create their own peer-reviewed open access journal. In addition to distributing print copies of the journal, they wanted to make the issues and articles available online, free for everyone to access.

### Project Highlights

There weren’t any commercial WordPress products for publishing issue-based publications at the time, so I built a custom solution using the newly released custom post type feature in WordPress. Issues and articles each had custom interfaces within the WordPress admin, making it easy for admins to add articles and publish new issues.

I integrated the site with a cloud service called ‘Crocodocs’ to embed a highly functional PDF version of each article. The entire issue was also able to be viewed fullscreen in a magazine-style reader using another cloud service, Issue.
