Author Dan Borengasser needed a website to showcase his books and provide links to purchase them on amazon.com. He wanted the website to match the playful and whimsical style of his stories and their cover art.

### Services Provided

Web design and development

### Project Highlights

The author had sent a copy of one of his books to Grammy Award winning musician and songwriter Willie Nelson. Willie enjoyed the book so much, he recorded himself reading the book and sent it back to Dan. We built a custom audio player that played the recording chapter by chapter.
