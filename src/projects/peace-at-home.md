The Peace at Home family shelter had four widely different demographics using their website. The most important was women in potentially abusive environments who needed help or information. Another strong demographic was friends or family of those in abusive situations who needed information about how they could help. The site also served as a portal to connect with those seeking to donate or volunteer at the shelter. There were also user seeking information about the Shelterâ€™s thrift store, a major source of funding for the organization.

### Services Provided

Web design and development

### Project Highlights

The site users needed to have a clear way to exit the site to maintain their privacy at home. I included a static bar at the top of the site that would redirect to a Google search page when clicked.
